We recently showed that the inference of the dipole amplitude from electron–proton deep inelastic
scattering data can be written into a proper inverse problem. We identified that the problem is
a linear integral transform problem, and implemented a numerical reconstruction and closure
test to show that the approach is feasible. The dipole amplitude is related to the gluon density
inside the proton at high energy. To give some context for the problem, I will begin with a crash
course into high energy particle physics, what the proton is made of, and how inverse problems
can help answer open questions about the structure of the proton and the strong nuclear force
by enabling novel, powerful, and robust indirect measurement.
