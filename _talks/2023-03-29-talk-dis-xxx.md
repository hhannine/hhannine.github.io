We calculate [1] the contribution from the state production to the diffractive cross sections in deep inelastic scattering [2,3] at high energy. The obtained cross section is finite by itself and a part of the full next-to-leading order result for the diffractive structure functions. We perform the calculation in exact kinematics in the eikonal limit, and show that the previously known high-Q^2 [2] and large-M_x^2 [4] results for the structure functions can be extracted from our results in the appropriate limits. We furthermore discuss the steps required to obtain the full next-to-leading order results for the structure functions in the Color Glass Condensate formalism, and ongoing application of these results to phenomenology.
