Upcoming on 2025-11-18, 1 PM. [Event page here.](https://sites.google.com/view/jipsem)

I will discuss our recent theoretical physics paper ([arXiv:2509.05005](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05005)) where we formulated the inference of the dipole amplitude into a proper inverse problem for the first time. The dipole amplitude is related to the gluon density inside the proton at high energy. To give some context for the problem, I will begin with a crash course into high energy particle physics, what the proton is made of, and how inverse problems can help answer open questions about the structure of the proton and the strong nuclear force.
