In this talk I make the observation that the field of high-energy physics studying elementary particles is full of Inverse Problems. I introduce some key approaches that are taken by particle physicists in the task of observing the smallest building blocks of our universe and their phenomena. Especially in the study of quarks and gluons, the strongly interacting elementary particles, all observations are fundamentally indirect, since no color charged particles can ever be freely observed due to color confinement. We take a surface level look into how the theory of Standard Model is connected with particle collider experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and how that connection is used to infer information about elementary particles.
