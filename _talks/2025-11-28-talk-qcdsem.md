In our recent paper (https://doi.org/10.1103/7fhf-7fp4) we reformulated the dipole picture of deep inelastic scattering into a linear inverse problem. In this talk I will discuss how mathematical observations about the inference problem of constraining the dipole amplitude with DIS data allowed us to write the problem in this novel way. We applied standard inverse problems numerical methods to reconstruct the dipole amplitude from simulated data with realistic precision. This inverse problems approach opens a path towards a new kind of parametrization-free inference in high-energy physics.
