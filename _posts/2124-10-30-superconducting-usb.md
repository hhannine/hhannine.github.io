Maker culture meets computer DIY and high-energy physics
======
A dear friend and fellow computer hobbyist was finishing his gargantuan [PhD thesis](jyx) and I wanted to make something personalized as a gift. 
A natural choice was to make a custom mechanical keyboard cable, since we keyboard connoisseurs appreciate a beautiful usb cable.
But what is a thematically fitting component for a fresh doctor of theoretical particle physics? Well I thought that the superconducting Titanium--Niobium wire that
has been used in the superconducting magnets in the Large Hadron Collider would fit the bill. I asked around a little, and was able to acquire a sample of the original wire which was manufactured by a Finnish company:

In room temperature this acts as a highly pure copper wire with a thin tin anti-corrosion layer, and the Ti--Nb fibers that become superconducting in very cold temperatures (~2K) are encased within each wire of the bundle shown in the above photo.

How does one make a USB cable out of raw uninsulated electrical wire?
