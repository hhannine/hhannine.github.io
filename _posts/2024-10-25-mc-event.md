Public outreach in particle physics
======

Popularization of state-of-the-art research in high-energy physics faces a number of large challenges, which often stems from the abstract quantum field theory description of the Standard Model. Another more basic challenge is the fact that all the elementary particles are just not known by the general public. Graphical visualization as a medium offers a powerful way to explain physics in a more intuitive way, where a show-and-tell type of approach can be taken. 

The PhD thesis topic of Dr. Mikko Kuha offers a unique and intuitive view into the highly complicated physics processes happening in heavy ion collisions. This stems from the phenomenological approach to the simulation of the collisions, as the complex collision is described in concrete positions in space and time, and the probabilistic nature of the problem arises from the event-by-event fluctuations of the participating constituents.
