I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Jyväskylä. I got my master's degree in theoretical physics in 2017, and doctor's degree in theoretical particle physics in 2021. Presently I am working on inverse problems, which I would describe as 'the abstract theory of indirect measurements', and which is a powerful perspective to answer physically motivated questions using mathematics.
