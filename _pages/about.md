I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Jyv채skyl채. I got my master's degree in theoretical physics in 2017, and doctor's degree in theoretical particle physics in 2021. Presently I am working on inverse problems, which I would describe as 'the abstract theory of indirect measurements', and which is a powerful perspective to answer physically motivated questions using mathematics.

My work and research
======
Presently we are working on a novel construction of 'free geometry' on a Lorentzian manifold as a conformally invariant framework to consider inverse problems from general relativity and cosmology.

Another collaborative effort with two mathematics postdocs is applying the inverse problems perspective to my previous work in Color Glass Condensate picture of particle scattering, where we perform indirect measurement of the so-called dipole amplitude in a parametrization-bias-free way.

Public outreach and scientific communication
======
I am highly interested in exploring the use of visual media in the communication of state-of-the-art research. I explore these ideas and topics in the Blog and Portfolio sections of these pages.

Background
======
I began my bachelor's studies at the University of Jyv채skyl채 in 2012 in the accelerated study program of physics, where the first 1.5 years of basic courses were condensed into 3 months, which was quite an intense experience. Of course with my love of mathematics and overly ambitious peers in the programme, on top of the physics course we took the same analysis courses that mainline mathematics students started with. We were quite whelmed. I got my Bachelor's in 2.5 years, and moved on to the theoretically oriented Master's programme in physics, which I finished in 2017. 

At this point I had a bit of a pause in momentum and a sense of uncertainty in my plans. Most of my close friends had moved from theoretical physics to pure mathamatics, which lead me to consider a PhD in mathematics at this point. I ended up following my heart and sticking with theoretical particle physics, and completed my thesis in 2021 after getting two children, with a third on the way. Following my defense I was able to stay for a year as a postdoc to finish two interesting projects in the particle physics group, after which I happily stumbled on the opportunity to join the Inverse Problems and mathematical physics group of Prof. Joonas Ilmavirta, which I believe has opened completely new horizons combining mathematics and theoretical physics.
