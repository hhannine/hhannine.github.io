Statistical physics is an intermediate level course.
As the course assistant I supervised weekly sessions where we went through the weekly assignments.
I was the assistant on the course on three subsequent years: 2015-1-5 -- 2015-4-15, 2016-1-11 -- 2016-4-11,
2017-1-9 -- 2017-3-29. On the last year, I designed some of the exercises in collaboration with the lecturer,
and wrote the example solutions.
