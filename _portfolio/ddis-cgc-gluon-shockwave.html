Many gluons propagating to and fro inside the shockwave in the Color Glass Condensate picture of particle scattering.

I drew these for my [PhD thesis](https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/78230), and wanted to explore drawing a more beautiful interpretation of the shockwave using the black-and-white style of Feynman diagrams.
