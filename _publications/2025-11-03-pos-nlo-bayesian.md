excerpt: 'We predict heavy quark production cross sections in Deep Inelastic Scattering at high energy by applying the CGC effective theory. We demonstrate that when the calculation is performed consistently at next-to-leading order accuracy with massive quarks it becomes possible, for the first time in the dipole picture with perturbatively calculated center-of-mass energy evolution, to simultaneously describe both light and heavy quark production data at small xx. We furthermore show how the heavy quark cross section data provides additional strong constraints on the extracted non-perturbative initial condition for the small-x evolution equations.'

Abstract: We use Bayesian inference to constrain the parameters describing the initial amplitude input to the Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equation at next-to-leading order accuracy against precise HERA total inclusive cross section and heavy quark data. The datasets are found to provide stringent constraints and, with consistent NLO treatment, a successful description of the data is obtained. The posterior distributions define the theoretical uncertainites that surround the non-perturbative initial condition and, thus, provide a way to propagate said uncertainties to CGC calculations at NLO.
