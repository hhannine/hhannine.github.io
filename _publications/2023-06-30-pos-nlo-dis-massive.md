excerpt: 'We predict heavy quark production cross sections in Deep Inelastic Scattering at high energy by applying the CGC effective theory. We demonstrate that when the calculation is performed consistently at next-to-leading order accuracy with massive quarks it becomes possible, for the first time in the dipole picture with perturbatively calculated center-of-mass energy evolution, to simultaneously describe both light and heavy quark production data at small xx. We furthermore show how the heavy quark cross section data provides additional strong constraints on the extracted non-perturbative initial condition for the small-x evolution equations.'

Abstract: We predict heavy quark production cross sections in Deep Inelastic Scattering at high energy by applying the CGC effective theory. We demonstrate that when the calculation is performed consistently at next-to-leading order accuracy with massive quarks it becomes possible, for the first time in the dipole picture with perturbatively calculated center-of-mass energy evolution, to simultaneously describe both light and heavy quark production data at small x. We furthermore show how the heavy quark cross section data provides additional strong constraints on the extracted non-perturbative initial condition for the small-x evolution equations.
