excerpt: 'We predict heavy quark production cross sections in Deep Inelastic Scattering at high energy by applying the CGC effective theory. We demonstrate that when the calculation is performed consistently at next-to-leading order accuracy with massive quarks it becomes possible, for the first time in the dipole picture with perturbatively calculated center-of-mass energy evolution, to simultaneously describe both light and heavy quark production data at small xx. We furthermore show how the heavy quark cross section data provides additional strong constraints on the extracted non-perturbative initial condition for the small-x evolution equations.'

Abstract: We calculate the contribution from the qqbarg state production to the diffractive cross sections in deep inelastic scattering at high energy. The obtained cross section is finite by itself, and consists a part of the full next-to-leading order result for the diffractive structure functions. Our calculation for the diffractive structure functions is performed using exact kinematics, under the shockwave approximation of the scattering process. Once the calculation is completed, we show that the previously known behaviour at the high-Q^2 and large-M_x^2 regime can be extracted from our results by taking the appropriate limits. Furthermore, we discuss the steps required to obtain the complete next-to-leading order results for the structure functions in the color glass condensate (CGC) formalism, and the application of these results to phenomenology.
